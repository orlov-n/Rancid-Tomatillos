# Rancid Tomatillos
  ### About The Project

Rancid Tomatillos allows the user to browse movies, see movie details and watch their trailers. 

This was a part of Turing School Software & Design module 3 project.

### Getting Started
 1. Clone this repo to your location machine from [Here](git@github.com:orlov-n/Rancid-Tomatillos.git)
 2. cd into Rancid-Tomatillos
 3. Next you will want to run in your command line: `npm install`. You will not want to run npm audit fix.
 4. To open the application in your browser you will want to run `npm start`. This will run webpack from your terminal. It should show in your terminal http://localhost:3000/
 5. Copy and past http://localhost:3000/ to your webbrowser. Google Chrome may work best. 
 6. Once you are done viewing the application you can go back to your terminal to close it. You will want to type Control + C and this will stop webpack from running on your local host. 

### Using the Application
